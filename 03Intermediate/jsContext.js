sayHello();//works because of global context

function sayHello()
{
    console.log("hello");
}

//there is global obj inside the js
//dev tool > console


//there is no window globol context in the node

//once the function is present then it is wrapped up and put inside the global context of JavaScript

//window context is present inside browser
//node, and other engines has different contexts
